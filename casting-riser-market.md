<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casting Riser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Blind Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The casting riser market is segmented into two main types: open type and blind type. Open type risers are designed with an exposed top, allowing for easy access to the molten metal and enabling gas escape during solidification. In contrast, blind type risers have a closed top, limiting exposure to external elements and minimizing contamination but requiring careful management of heat retention. Both types serve critical roles in ensuring quality and efficiency in foundry processes, depending on specific casting requirements.</p></p>
